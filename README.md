(PC ONLY!!!)How to Set Up the Damage Meter for Celtic Heroes Using Cheat Engine 7.6:

- Open Cheat Engine 7.6

- Attach Cheat Engine to the Celtic Heroes process by clicking the computer icon in the top-left corner, selecting the Celtic Heroes process from the list, then clicking Open

- Load the Celtic Heroes .CT file by clicking File, then Load, navigating to the folder where the .CT file is saved, and opening it

- Run the assembly script in the lower panel of Cheat Engine

- Open the built-in Lua engine inside Cheat Engine by going to Table, then "Show Cheat Table Lua Script"

- Scroll to the bottom of that Lua script and find the "local basePath = ..." variable. Change it to the folder where you downloaded the file

- Execute the Lua script

- Run Damage_Meter_Visuals.exe

If everything went well, you should see player and enemy damage appear in the Damage Meter Visuals window!
